# AI-Powered Credit Risk Scoring System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered credit risk scoring system that predicts whether a loan applicant is high-risk or low-risk. The model is trained on financial data using **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**, with explainability provided by **SHAP** and **LIME**. The system also includes a **Streamlit-based web app** for user interaction and risk assessment.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
### **1. Install Dependencies**
Before running the project, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:)*
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost shap lime streamlit joblib
```

### **2. Run the Streamlit App**
Execute the following command in the project directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the **credit risk prediction app** in your browser.

### **3. Interact with the App**
- Enter applicant details such as **income, age, home ownership, loan intent, and credit history**.
- Click **"Predict Credit Risk"** to get an AI-driven risk assessment.

## ðŸ›  Model Training and Explainability
- The models are trained on **Logistic Regression** and **XGBoost**.
- Feature importance is analyzed using **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
âœ… **Machine Learning Models** - Logistic Regression & XGBoost for risk prediction.  
âœ… **Explainability** - SHAP & LIME to explain model decisions.  
âœ… **Data Preprocessing** - Handles missing values and categorical variables.  
âœ… **Interactive Dashboard** - Built using **Streamlit** for user-friendly risk assessment.  
âœ… **Scalability** - The trained model can be extended with new data.  

## ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
- Add **real-time API integration** for live financial data.
- Improve feature engineering for better prediction accuracy.
- Expand explainability using **counterfactual explanations**.
